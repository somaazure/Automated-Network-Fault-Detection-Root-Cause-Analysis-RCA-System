## Incident Summary
A fiber node in Zone-12 experienced a complete outage, with 100% packet loss. Multiple attempts to restart the node by the Operations team failed, resulting in ticket escalations to the Network Operation Center (NOC).

## Incident Severity
**P1** (Critical): The incident disrupted all connectivity through the affected node, resulting in complete packet loss. Given the high impact on services and the prolonged downtime with unsuccessful mitigations, a P1 classification is justified.

## Impact Analysis
- **Affected services**: All network-dependent services routed through Zone-12 experienced complete unavailability.
- **Duration**: Issue spanned from initial detection on 2025-08-22 until resolution attempts were handed over to the NOC.
- **Scope**: Entire Fiber node in Zone-12 was impacted.

## Root Cause
The root cause appears to be a significant failure of the fiber node in Zone-12 resulting in 100% packet loss. This may be attributed to hardware malfunction or severe transmission issues; however, further investigation by the NOC is necessary for detailed findings.

## Corrective Actions Taken
- Restart attempts by the Operations team.
- Multiple escalations to NOC Level-2 for advanced troubleshooting.
- Incident tickets were repeatedly created for tracking and updates.

## Preventive Measures
- Conduct a detailed post-mortem analysis once the issue is resolved by the NOC.
- Evaluate redundancy options for critical nodes to ensure service continuity during similar outages.
- Perform routine health checks on fiber nodes to proactively identify potential failures.
