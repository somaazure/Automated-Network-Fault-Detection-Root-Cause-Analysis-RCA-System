## Incident Summary

On 2025-08-22, the core router CR-45 became unreachable, resulting in failures to update routing tables across the network.

## Incident Severity

**P2** (High Priority)

This classification is justified due to the limited scope of the impact, which was mitigated relatively quickly. While the router outage affected routing tables and could have cascaded to impact services, the issue was addressed effectively within a standard response timeframe.

## Impact Analysis

- Temporary routing table failures as CR-45 was offline.
- Unavailability of routing updates for a brief period.
- Service operations fully restored after the restart, with no significant degradation reported.

## Root Cause

The core router CR-45 became unresponsive due to an unknown operational fault. The failure likely resulted from internal errors but requires further analysis.

## Corrective Actions Taken

- Restart request initiated for Node CR-45.
- Restart procedure completed successfully.
- Heartbeat and operational KPIs verified for network stability.

## Preventive Measures

- Conduct a thorough audit of CR-45 error logs for potential failure patterns.
- Implement automated failover mechanisms for critical routers.
- Increase monitoring intervals for core network devices.
