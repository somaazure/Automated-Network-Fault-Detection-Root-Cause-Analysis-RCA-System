## Incident Summary
A critical network outage occurred due to a fiber node failure in Zone-12, resulting in 100% packet loss. Attempts to restart the fiber node were unsuccessful, necessitating escalation to higher support levels.

## Incident Severity
**Severity Classification:** P1
The severity was classified as P1 since the fiber node failure directly resulted in complete service disruption (100% packet loss) for Zone-12, impacting critical network operations and requiring escalations to NOC Level 2 support repeatedly within a short timeframe.

## Impact Analysis
The incident caused a network failure in Zone-12, leading to disruption of service for all customers in this zone. Continuous packet loss impacted business operations, online services, and critical communications dependent on the network infrastructure.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the incident was a failure of the fiber node in Zone-12. Restart attempts were unsuccessful, indicating possible hardware failure or unresolvable configuration issues.

## Corrective Actions Taken
- Immediate restart attempts on the failed fiber node.
- Logs generated and incidents escalated to NOC Level 2 for advanced troubleshooting.
- Persistent escalations and ticket creation during the escalation process to ensure visibility and prioritization.

## Preventive Measures
- Regular inspection and preventative maintenance of fiber nodes.
- Deployment of redundant infrastructure in critical zones to minimize future outages.
- Improved diagnostic capabilities to identify issues early and reduce resolution time.
