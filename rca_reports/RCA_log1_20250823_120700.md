## Incident Summary
On August 22, 2025, a fiber node in Zone-12 experienced a complete failure, resulting in 100% packet loss. Multiple attempts at remediation were unsuccessful, leading to repeated escalations to the Network Operations Center (NOC) Layer 2.

## Incident Severity
**P1**
The incident has been classified as P1 due to the following:
1. Complete packet loss (100%) impacting connectivity.
2. Failure of initial remediation attempts.
3. Extended outage duration from August 22 to August 23, with repeated escalations.

## Impact Analysis
The outage affected all network traffic routed through the fiber node in Zone-12. This likely disrupted services for end-users and customers in the affected area, leading to potential revenue impact and reduced customer satisfaction.

## Root Cause
The root cause for the fiber node failure in Zone-12 remains under investigation. The repeated failure of remediation attempts suggests either a hardware fault or an issue with underlying network configurations.

## Corrective Actions Taken
1. Attempts at restarting and remediating the fiber node were made by the operations team.
2. The issue was escalated to NOC L2 for advanced troubleshooting and resolution.
3. Tickets have been created with logs attached for further analysis.

## Preventive Measures
1. Comprehensive hardware diagnostics and replacement of potential faulty components in fiber nodes.
2. Implementation of enhanced monitoring tools to detect and resolve such issues preemptively.
3. Conducting a review of network redundancy protocols in Zone-12 to ensure failover options are adequate.
