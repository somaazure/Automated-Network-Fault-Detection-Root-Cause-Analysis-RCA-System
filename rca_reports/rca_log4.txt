## Incident Summary
On August 27, 2025, multiple network incidents were observed, including node outages, congestion, and resource utilization spikes. Among these, a fiber cut between Hub-East and Hub-North caused a significant service outage in Region-North, affecting approximately 320,000 subscribers. This incident required emergency escalation and impacted multiple eNB nodes.

## Incident Severity
**Classification: P1**  
The incident involving the fiber cut in Region-North qualifies as a P1 severity due to the widespread service outage affecting 320,000 subscribers, the involvement of multiple nodes (Node-22, Node-24, Node-25), and the need for emergency escalation. The impact on a large subscriber base and the extended recovery process align with the P1 criteria.

## Impact Analysis
- **Affected Nodes:** Node-22, Node-24, Node-25.
- **Affected Region:** Region-North.
- **Subscribers Impacted:** Approximately 320,000.
- **Service Outage:** Severe disruption in telecommunication services in Region-North. Partial service restoration was achieved for 45% of users via redundant routing.
- **Business Impact:** Significant degradation of service quality, potential SLA breaches, and customer dissatisfaction.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the incident was determined to be a **fiber cut** caused by third-party digging activities between Hub-East and Hub-North. The disruption severed critical links, leading to node outages and service degradation.

## Corrective Actions Taken
1. Emergency escalation was triggered to address the service outage.
2. Backup path activation was initiated via redundant network rings.
3. Traffic was successfully rerouted, restoring partial service to 45% of affected users.
4. Full network rerouting was completed, stabilizing traffic and restoring services.
5. Root cause analysis identified the third-party digging as the source of the fiber cut.

## Preventive Measures
1. **Enhanced Network Monitoring:** Implement proactive monitoring to detect link instability earlier.
2. **Third-Party Coordination:** Strengthen coordination and communication with third-party contractors to prevent accidental disruptions.
3. **Redundant Network Paths:** Expand redundant network topologies to ensure minimal disruption in case of fiber cuts.
4. **Emergency Response Drills:** Conduct regular drills to improve response times for major outages.
