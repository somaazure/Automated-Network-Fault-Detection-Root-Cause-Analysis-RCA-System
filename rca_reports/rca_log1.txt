## Incident Summary
On August 22, 2025, at 10:14:32, a fiber node failure occurred in Zone-12 causing 100% packet loss. Multiple attempts to restart the node and remediate the issue were unsuccessful. Escalations to the Network Operations Center (NOC) Level 2 (L2) occurred repeatedly, and the issue persisted for an extended duration without resolution.

## Incident Severity
**Severity Classification: P1**

Justification: Based on the severity classification provided and the log analysis, this incident qualifies as P1 due to the complete outage (100% packet loss) of a critical fiber node, the repeated failure to remediate, and the escalation to NOC L2. This represents a high-impact, time-sensitive issue requiring immediate resolution.

## Impact Analysis
The fiber node failure in Zone-12 resulted in:
- **100% Packet Loss**: Complete disruption of network traffic in the affected area.
- **Prolonged Downtime**: Issue persisted for more than 24 hours with multiple failed remediation attempts.
- **Operational Disruption**: Continuous escalations to NOC L2 highlight the inability to restore services at the operational level.
- **Potential Customer Impact**: Services dependent on the affected fiber node were likely unavailable, impacting end-users.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the incident is not explicitly identified in the logs provided. However, the persistence of the issue despite remediation attempts suggests a critical hardware failure or a systemic issue within the fiber node infrastructure in Zone-12.

## Corrective Actions Taken
1. Restart attempts of the fiber node were initiated but failed.
2. The issue was escalated to NOC L2 for further investigation and resolution.
3. Incident tickets were systematically created and updated with logs for detailed tracking and escalation.

## Preventive Measures
1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement advanced monitoring tools to detect and diagnose fiber node issues proactively.
2. **Infrastructure Audit**: Conduct a thorough inspection of hardware and systems in Zone-12 to identify vulnerabilities or systemic faults.
3. **Redundancy Plans**: Establish redundant fiber links to mitigate the impact of node failures.
4. **Escalation Process Review**: Streamline escalation procedures to minimize delays in resolution during critical incidents.
5. **Training Programs**: Provide additional training to operational teams to handle similar incidents more effectively.
