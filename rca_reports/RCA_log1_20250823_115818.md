## Incident Summary
On August 22, 2025, at 10:14:32, a critical outage occurred due to a fiber node failure in Zone-12, causing 100% packet loss. Multiple attempts to restore connectivity failed, leading to escalations and prolonged service disruptions.

## Incident Severity
**P1**

The incident is classified as P1 due to the critical nature of the fiber node failure, which resulted in complete packet loss (100%) and prolonged impact on Zone-12. Multiple remediation attempts failed, indicating significant operational and customer impact.

## Impact Analysis
- **Affected Area:** Zone-12.
- **Impact:** Total loss of connectivity within the zone.
- **Duration:** Prolonged outage, escalated multiple times with issues persisting over two days.
- **Operational Significance:** Continuity of internet service was entirely disrupted, impacting service levels and potentially SLA commitments.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the incident was the failure of a fiber node in Zone-12. Hardware or connectivity failure in the primary infrastructure triggered the outage, and subsequent remedial attempts did not restore service.

## Corrective Actions Taken
- Restart attempts of the fiber node undertaken unsuccessfully.
- Multiple escalations were made to the NOC Level 2 team for further diagnostics and resolution efforts.
- Incident tickets were created and logged with detailed information for further examination.

## Preventive Measures
- Conduct proactive health checks and diagnostics on fiber nodes, especially in high-priority zones.
- Enhance monitoring with early detection systems for fiber node degradations.
- Develop a more robust real-time remediation strategy and allocate additional redundancy in critical network areas.
