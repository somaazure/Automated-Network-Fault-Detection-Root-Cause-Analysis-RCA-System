## Incident Summary
On August 22, 2025, at 10:42:11, the core router CR-45 became unreachable, resulting in routing table updates failing. The issue persisted until a manual restart of CR-45 was requested at 19:54:17. Following the restart, the router resumed normal operations, with all services stabilized and key performance indicators (KPIs) within acceptable thresholds.

## Incident Severity
**Severity Level:** P1  
**Justification:** According to the log analysis, the unavailability of the core router CR-45 disrupted routing table updates, which is critical for network stability and operation. This aligns with the severity classification of P1, as the incident had the potential to significantly impact network performance and availability.

## Impact Analysis
- Core router CR-45 was unreachable for approximately 9 hours and 12 minutes.
- Routing table updates failed during the outage, likely impacting traffic routing efficiency.
- There is no evidence of widespread packet loss or service degradation beyond the affected node, as indicated by post-restart KPIs.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the incident is not explicitly detailed in the logs. However, the outage was resolved by manually restarting the core router CR-45, suggesting a potential software or hardware fault that prevented normal operation.

## Corrective Actions Taken
- A restart of the affected node (CR-45) was manually initiated at 19:54:17.
- Following the restart, all services were restored, and the router's heartbeat was verified as operational.

## Preventive Measures
- Conduct a full diagnostic of CR-45 to identify potential hardware or software faults.
- Review and update monitoring tools to detect and alert on similar issues earlier.
- Evaluate and implement automated recovery mechanisms for critical nodes to reduce mean time to recovery (MTTR).
